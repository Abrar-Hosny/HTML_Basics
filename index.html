<!--
HTML is the raw data , 
All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML.

CSS is what adds style to those plain elements.
-> HTML puts information on a webpage,
-> CSS positions that information, makes it look great!
-------------------------------------------------------------
HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
there is two things html tags and elements
Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content 
wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.

+ Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element. 
They are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets <> , <p>

+ Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends.
 they have a forward slash before the </p>

 opening tags <p> ------here will be content------------------ </p> closing tags

 //You can think of elements as containers for content. 
 The opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the element contains. 
 The browser can then use that information to determine how it should interpret and format the content.

 there will see something called self closing tags or empty elements <br/>
 because they donâ€™t wrap any content.
